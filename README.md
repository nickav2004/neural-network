# Neural Network

## Simple Neural Network to recognize digits

This Neural Network is is being built for all purpose use and versitale. Right now it is being built to recognize 28x28 pixel images of digits.

## To Do

- Finish the back propagation Method

    - Implement a way to find the Gradient of the cost function for layer 
    - Calculate the Gradient for each layer 
    - Using the Gradient vector Update the Weights 

- Implement the training method
    - Implement the epoches 
    - Shuffle the Data
