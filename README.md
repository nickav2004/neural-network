# Neural Network

## Simple Neural Network to recognize handwritten digits

This neural network is being developed for versatile, all-purpose use. Currently, it is designed to recognize 28x28 pixel images of digits.

## To Do

- Finish the back propagation Method

    - Implement a way to find the Gradient of the cost function for layer 
    - Calculate the Gradient for each layer 
    - Using the Gradient vector Update the Weights 

- Implement the training method
    - Implement the epoches 
    - Shuffle the Data

- Implement a frontend to let people train the network
