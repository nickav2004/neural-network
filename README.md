# Neural Network

## Simple Neural Network to recognize digits

This Neural Network is is being built for all purpose use and versitale. Right now it is being built to recognize 28x28 pixel images of digits.

## To Do

- Finish the back propagation Method

    - Implement a way to find the Gradient vector 

- Implement the training method
